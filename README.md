## Description

PS Blog is an website designed to keep users connected to the latest Play Station News. Moderated by the PS Blog team, Anyone with an account can post on this website. Users can access their blogposts as well as comment on posts added by other users. 

The primary motivation behind developing PS Blog was to solidify my knowledge of MVC. I was to bould a blog website using my knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, APIs, git, and Tailwind CSS. Throughout the development process, I gained valuable insights into API requests, authorization, authentication, and sessions. Making use of the Handlebars templating engine, as well as utilizing controllers and Sequelize, was crucial to completing this project successfully.
